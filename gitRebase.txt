Git Rebase:-

Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit.

git rebase command- "git rebase origin/master"

Above command will merge in the requested branch (origin/master here) and apply the commits that we have made locally to the top of the history without creating a merge commit.
