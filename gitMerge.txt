Git merge- 
The git merge command takes the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

merge command- "git merge source_branch_name"

The current branch will be updated to reflect the merge, but the target branch will be completely unaffected. 
Git can automatically merge commits unless there are changes that conflict in both commit sequences.
