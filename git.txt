Problems solved by Git
1) When a code is written/developed by a Developer then he has that only code in his/her local repository and to share that file git is useful by providing the link of remote repository.

2) When the development team contains more than one member then we can use the concept of branching and merging.

3) The manager can keep track of history of commits.
