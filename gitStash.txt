Stash:-
 Use git stash when we want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory.
 This command saves us local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.

 
 The git stash command takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy
